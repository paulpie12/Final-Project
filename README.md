The point of the game is to complete 3 levels each with a different objective. The levels can be completed in any order, and once you do all 3 of them, you win the game. In the Bank, your goal is to steal the Tunisian Diamond before you run out of time. In the Museum, your goal is to collect a certain amount of paintings without getting caught by the guards. In the white house, your goal will be to not get spotted by the security cameras, as you steal the declaration of independence.
